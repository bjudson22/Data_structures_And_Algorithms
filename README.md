# Data Structures and Algorithms
This is a dump for the data structures and algorithms I have written and am writing on an ongoing basis. 
The current focus is on python but I will add various functions in C# as well in the near future. Feel free to criticize
or make suggestions on any of my code, as this is simply a working demonstration of my coding abilities.
